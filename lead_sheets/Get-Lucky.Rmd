# Get-Lucky

Like the legend of the phoenix  
All ends with beginnings  
What keeps the planet spinning  
The force from the beginning  
(Look)  
We've come too far to give up who we are  
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars  
She's up all night till the sun  
I'm up all night to get some  
She's up all night for good fun  
I'm up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night till the sun  
We're up all night to get some  
We're up all night for good fun  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
The present has no rhythm  
Your gift keeps on giving  
What is this I'm feeling?  
If you wanna leave I'm with it  
We've come too far to give up who we are  
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars  
She's up all night till the sun  
I'm up all night to get some  
She's up all night for good fun  
I'm up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night till the sun  
We're up all night to get some  
We're up all night for good fun  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky  
We're up all night to get lucky
